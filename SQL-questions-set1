    LONG_W int
) ;

insert into STATION values(794, 'Kissee Mills', 'MO', 139, 73);

insert into STATION values(266, 'Cahone', 'CO', 116, 127);

Sol'n: select CITY,STATE from STATION; 

##Q8. Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. 
##Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.

Sol'n: select DISTINCT CITY from STATION where MOD(ID,2)=0 order by CITY;

## Q9. Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

Sol'n: select count( CITY)-count(DISTINCT CITY) AS Diff_City_DisCity from STATION;


## Q10. Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their  respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

Query1: To find largest city and its length

select CITY,LENGTH(CITY) from STATION order by LENGTH(CITY) desc, CITY limit 1; 

Query 2: To find smallest city and its length

select CITY,LENGTH(CITY) from STATION order by LENGTH(CITY) asc, CITY limit 1; 

##Q11. Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Query : SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) FROM STATION WHERE CITY LIKE 'a%' OR CITY LIKE 'e%' OR CITY LIKE 'i%' OR CITY LIKE 'o%' 
OR CITY LIKE 'u%';    

OR 

Query : SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[AEOIU]';

( REGEXP operator is not case sensitive , ^ is Beginning of string , [] is Any character listed between the square brackets )
 
 
 ## Q12. Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Query :
SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) FROM STATION WHERE CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' 
OR CITY LIKE '%u';    
Or

Query: 
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY REGEXP '[AEOIU]$';

(where $ is end of a string)

## Q13. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Query : select DISTINCT CITY from STATION where CITY REGEXP '^[^aeiou]'; 

or

Query : 
select distinct CITY from STATION 
where city Not like 'a%' and city Not like 'e%' and city Not like 'i%' and
      city Not like 'o%' and city not like 'u%';
 
 
 ## Q14. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Query: 
select distinct CITY from STATION 
where CITY Not like '%a' and CITY Not like '%e' and CITY Not like '%i' and
      CITY Not like '%o' and CITY not like '%u';
