Q71. Write an SQL query to find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.
     The indirect relation between managers will not exceed three managers as the company is small.
     Return the result table in any order.
 
create table Employees 
(employee_id int,
employee_name varchar(20),
manager_id int);

insert into Employees values
(1,'Boss',1),
(3,'Alice', 3),
(2,'Bob', 1),
(4,'Daniel', 2),
(7,'Luis', 4),
(8,'Jhon', 3),
(9,'Angela', 8),
(77,'Robert', 1);


Select employee_id,manager_id FROM Employees WHERE manager_id in(select employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE manager_id in (SELECT employee_id FROM Employees WHERE manager_id=1))
and employee_id != manager_id;
