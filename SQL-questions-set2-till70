Q61. Write an SQL query to report the shortest distance between any two points from the Point table. 

create table point(x int);

insert into point values (-1),(0),(2);

SELECT * from point;

SELECT MIN(ABS(p1.x-p2.x)) as Shortest_Path
FROM point p1
CROSS JOIN point p2
WHERE p1.x <> p2.x ;

Q62.Write a SQL query for a report that provides the pairs (actor_id, director_id) where the actor has cooperated with the director at least three times.
    Return the result table in any order.

create table ActorDirector(actor_id int,director_id int,timestamp int);

insert into ActorDirector values
(1,1,0),
(1,1,1),
(1,1,2),
(1,2,3),
(1,2,4),
(2,1,5),
(2,1,6);

SELECT * from ActorDirector;


select actor_id,director_id 
from (
    select actor_id,director_id,count(*) cooperated ,
    dense_rank() over(order by count(*) desc) rnk FROM
    ActorDirector group by actor_id,director_id)a 
    where a.rnk = 1;

WITH cte AS(select actor_id,director_id,
ROW_NUMBER() over(PARTITION BY actor_id) rnk 
FROM ActorDirector)

SELECT actor_id,director_id 
FROM cte WHERE rnk=3
 ;

SELECT actor_id,director_id
FROM 
ActorDirector
GROUP BY actor_id,director_id
HAVING COUNT(timestamp)>=3;
